I am an ecologist, naturalist, and marine biologist interested in the phenomena occurring at the base of aquatic food webs.

I am an expert in DNA barcoding, environmental DNA, quantitative PCR-based methods, and next-generation DNA sequencing. Current research projects utilize these techniques to explore trophic mismatches in high latitude ecosystems, identify indicator species in estuarine wetlands, and dig deep into the diverse prey important to larval fishes.
