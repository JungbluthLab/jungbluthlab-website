Exploration of Earth's microbial and viral diversity is a major scientific frontier. Sequencing DNA — the blueprint of life — collected directly from the environment provides a powerful way to access the fantastic microbial diversity on our planet. These mostly unknown lifeforms are ripe with novel functions, metabolisms, the potential for biotechnological and medical applications. They will also inform us about the evolution of all life.

My previous work has explored the nature and extent of microbial life underground and below the seafloor using tools rooted in molecular biology, biogeochemistry, and microbiology. Now I employ computational tools and leverage big data to continue exploring microbes at a larger scale. And while doing so, I develop software enabling molecular microbial ecology research for others.
