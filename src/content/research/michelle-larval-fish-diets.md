Currently, I am working on a project using DNA sequencing to study the larval diet of a threatened species of fish in the San Francisco Estuary — the longfin smelt (*Spirinchus thaleichthyes*). This fish is one of many struggling fishes in the San Francisco Estuary ecosystem and my work will help us to understand what food resources they need to survive and whether food is what is limiting their populations.
