In order to study copepod populations at a finer scale, I have further developed a DNA-based method that allows me to estimate animal abundance using a combination of size-based separation and quantification of species-specific DNA. I have also dabbled in DNA barcoding of deep-sea larval invertebrates — a location where we know almost nothing about organism diversity and even less about larval ecology.
